    <h2>Namespaces and Scope</h2>

    <p><b>Scope</b> is how variables and functions are defined and accessed. Local scope refers variables and functions
        that are only accessible from inside a function, as opposed to Global scope in which they are accessible from
        anywhere.</p>

    <p>As a convention, generally it is a bad idea to modify variables within the global scope. Accessing (reading) from
        global is fine, but can create confusion if it is changed between functions. These are called <b>global
            constants</b>, and having them is fine, but changing them is not. Conventionally, these are declared in all
        capitals.</p>

    <p>Python doesn't have Block scope, in which variables and functions are defined within if statements or the like.
    </p>

    <p>Whenever you give name to a function or a variable, that is called the <b>Namespace</b>.</p>
