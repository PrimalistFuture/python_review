      Scrapping with BeautifulSoup is effective, but we can't do everything we
      might want to, like click buttons or type into input fields or scroll.

      Selenium will let us mimic all of that to interact and communicate with
      the browser.

      ourselves. S

    <p>
      This can end up being way faster because the browser is automatically
      sending a bunch of the headers and whatnot that we can't mimic as easily
      with requests and BeautifulSoup.
