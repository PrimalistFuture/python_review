    <h1>Webscrapping with Beautiful Soup</h1>

    <p>
      Someweb sites don't have an api or the api doesn't let us do the things we
      want it to do. Beautiful Soup will let us find the information on the html
      of websites that we care about, and pull out just the relevant bits.
    </p>

    <p>
      NEW INFORMATION: IF YOU GOT TO ANY WEBSITE LIKE AND PUT /ROBOTS.TXT AFTER
      IT, IT WILL TELL YOU WANT THEY ARE COOL AND NOT COOL WITH YOU SCRAPPING.
      COOL.
