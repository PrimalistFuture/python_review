    <h1>Email SMTP and datetime</h1>

    <p>Sending email with python code. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</p>

    <p>They want me to create a few new emails. I don't think im going to do that.</p>

    <p>Angela also uses a service called python anywhere that hosts and runs some python code from the cloud for you. I
