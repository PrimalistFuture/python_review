    <h1>API Endpoints and API Parameters</h1>

    <p>APIs are a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that programmers can use to create software or
        interact with external systems.</p>

    <p>Essentially APIs are barriers between your program and some external software or system.</p>

    <p>Often used to get some other entities data.</p>

    <p>The endpoint is some usually some URL that you can get some data from.</p>

    <p>A request has to be made over the internet. It can be as simple as going to the endpoint, but it usually wants
        you to format the request in a certain way and give them certain data about your credentials or whatever.</p>

    <p>API can also have parameters, which can be used to configure the data that you get back</p>
    <p>Good API documentation will tell you want parameters the API expects, and which are optional, as well as what
        shape they want the parameter to be.</p>
