    <h1>Advanced Authentication and HTTP Headers</h1>

    <h2>HTTP Requests</h2>

    <p>We've seen GET requests where we retrieve data from elsewhere. But there are other types of requests.</p>

    <p>POST requests are when we give that external system some piece of data.</p>

    <p>PUT requests are for updating a piece of data from the external system.</p>

    <p>DELETE requests delete ... from the external system.</p>

    <h2>HTTP Headers</h2>

    <p>Headers are like the address and and other metadata. </p>
