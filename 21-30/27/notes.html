    <h1>GUI with TKinter and functional arguments</h1>


    <h2>TKinter</h2>

    <p>Comes pre-installed with python. Similar in many ways to Turtle Graphics that we have been using.</p>

    <h2>Advanced Python Arguments</h2>

    <p>We know we can provide arguments in any order as long as we label them.CTD.</p>

    <p>**kwargs lets us look through all of the inputs to a function, and pick the ones we want to do whatever with.</p>
