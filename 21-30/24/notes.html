    <h1>File System</h1>

    <p>The course updated the snake game to track high scores, but I am just going to copy the specific file path
        lessons.</p>

    <p>Holy shit I learned something: check out the top of the demo file for a quick demo</p>

    <h2>Absolute vs Relative Path</h2>

    <p>A single forward / indicates your root folder. An absolute file path always starts are the root. But a relative
        path starts relative to the folder we are currently in. Check the demo for how to figure out the folder you are
        currently working in!</p>

    <p>A . indicates to look at the current folder ./Reports/Weeks. But the ./ is optional for files within the current
        Reports/Weeks
        directory</p>
    <p>Two .. indicates to look up ../report.doc</p>
