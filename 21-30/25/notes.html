    <p>Working with CSVs and pandas</p>

    <p>CSV stands for comma seperated values. Each row is a single set of data, and each piece of data is seperated by
        commas.</p>

    <p>Pandas is a library used for helping out with data, including CSVs. It has two types of data it will return, a
        series - which is like a column in the CSV, and a dataFrame, which is the the entire CSV.</p>
    <p>Pandas has support for turning a series into other data types, like a dictionary, or a list or whatever.</p>
    <p>In general, their documentation is very good.</p>
