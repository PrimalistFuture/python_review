# Instructions
# Write a program that works out whether if a given number is
# an odd or even number.

# Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

# e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43

# 43 does not have any decimal places.
# Therefore the division is clean.

# e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5

# 29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places.
# Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

# The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python.
# It gives you the remainder after a division.

# e.g.
# 6 Ã· 2 = 3 with no remainder.
# therefore: 6 % 2 = 0
# 5 Ã· 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.

# Which number do you want to check?
number = int(input())
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
if number % 2 == 0:
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    print("This is an odd number.")


# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's
# weight and height.

# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Equal to or over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese

# Enter your height in meters e.g., 1.55
height = float(input())
# Enter your weight in kilograms e.g., 72
weight = int(input())
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bmi = (weight / (height ** 2))
if bmi < 18.5:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are underweight.")
elif bmi < 25:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you have a normal weight.")
elif bmi < 30:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are slightly overweight.")
elif bmi < 35:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are obese.")
else:
    print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you are clinically obese.")


# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
# A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in
# February.
# The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating,
# this video does it more justice.

# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

# on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder

# except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder

# unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder

# If english is not your first language or if the above logic is confusing,
# try using this flow chart .

# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
# 2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
# 2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)

# So the year 2000 is a leap year.
# But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

# 2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)
# 2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
# 2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly,
# including spelling an punctuation.

# Example Input 1
# 2400
# Example Output 1
# Leap year
# Example Input 2
# 1989
# Example Output 2
# Not leap year

# Which year do you want to check?
year = int(input())
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
if year % 4 != 0:
    print("Not leap year")
elif year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0:
    print("Leap year")
elif year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 == 0 and year % 400 == 0:
    print("Leap year")
else:
    print("Not leap year")

# Medium pizza (M): $20
# Large pizza (L): $25
# Add pepperoni for small pizza (Y or N): +$2
# Add pepperoni for medium or large pizza (Y or N): +$3
# Add extra cheese for any size pizza (Y or N): +$1

# Example Input
# L
# Y
# N
# Example Output
# Thank you for choosing Python Pizza Deliveries!
# Your final bill is: $28.

# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between
# two people.
# To work out the love score between two people:
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters
# in the word TRUE occurs.
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
# "Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# "Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# "Your score is *z*."
# e.g.

# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# T occurs 0 times
# R occurs 1 time
# U occurs 2 times
# E occurs 2 times
# Total = 5

# L occurs 1 time
# O occurs 0 times
# V occurs 0 times
# E occurs 2 times
# Total = 3

# Love Score = 53
# Print: "Your score is 53."

# These functions will help you:
# lower() count()

# Example Input 1
# Kanye West
# Kim Kardashian
# Example Output 1
# The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
# Your score is 42, you are alright together.
# Example Input 2
# Brad Pitt
# Jennifer Aniston

# The Love Calculator is calculating your score...
